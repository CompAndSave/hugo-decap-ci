[![](/blog/images/canon-printer.jpg)](/blog/images/canon-printer.jpg)Taking pictures is a great way to save and share memories. But what happens after you take the  
picture? Today, it is more common to share it online or save it to your computer rather than print them out. But printing out pictures is a great way to keep those memories you cherish on display at all times. So what's the trick to getting quality, affordable prints? You can start out by making sure you have the right supplies!  

### Choosing A Printer

There are many factors you should keep in mind when printing pictures, but first and foremost, you need to make sure you have a printer that has photo printing capabilities. All printer manufacturers have some great options, so do your research beforehand so you choose a printer that best fits your needs. In general, inkjet printers will produce higher quality prints with vivid color and high contrasts.

Here are a few top printers you may want to check out:

### Picking Your Paper

Next, you want to make sure you are printing on the right kind of [photo paper](https://www.comboink.com/paper). There are several types you can choose from, so here's a rundown of each type and it's purpose:

**[Glossy](https://www.comboink.com/paperphoto-paper/glossy-photo-paper)**\- The most widely used type of paper which ranges in degrees of glossiness. Common for printing photos, the glossy shine helps small details pop out. However, the gloss may create glares from some viewpoints. 

**[Matte](https://www.comboink.com/paperphoto-paper/matte-photo-paper)**\- Matte is not glossy and a cheaper option. Commonly used to print large quantities for flyers, large quantities of marketing collateral or in black and white.

**[Lustre](https://www.comboink.com/paperphoto-paper/lustre-photo-paper)**\- Has a satin finish with a textured feel. Produces more professional prints. 

**[Canvas](https://www.comboink.com/paperphoto-paper/canvas-photo-paper)**\- A heavy weight paper with a coated, textured surface that replicates the feel of a canvas. Because it produces long lasting prints, canvas paper is most commonly used with paintings.

**Transfer Paper** \- With transfer paper, you can print out any design and create a unique, iron-on transfer that you can then iron onto any type of fabric that you desire.

**Magnetic Sheets** \- Great for printing small photos that you can hang on the fridge.
