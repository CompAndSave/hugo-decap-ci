All of us come equipped with the latest in gadgets these days – our smart phone, tablets and other handheld devices are really, really clever and are capable of much more than you may be aware of. Whether you have an Apple device that uses the Mac operating system or you have a device that bases itself on the Android platform, you can download and use some amazing apps for free; these are apps which help you utilize your phone in ways you never even imagined! 

Printing things wirelessly from your phone or tablet can make life a lot easier. Obviously you do need to have a Wi-Fi (wireless) enabled printer, which receives radio (rather like Bluetooth) to start printing. In other words your printer should have a Wi-Fi transceiver built into it. You would have to install the printer to the network so that your phone or tablet can locate the printer. Once your device is connected, it can send print jobs to the printer. Today we look at some free apps to get you started on Wi-Fi printing.
