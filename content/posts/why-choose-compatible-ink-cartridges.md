Compatible ink cartridges are a prefect replacement for the user of a HP printer. They are designed and made by a third party which is the base of their success. As the product is made by a third party this means that you can expect to pay a price of which is lower than the OEM or genuine ink cartridge. However it must be noted that just because you pay a low price for the use of a compatible ink cartridge, the quality is not of a lower standard, in fact you will find that the quality in which is produced is exactly the same as the genuine ink cartridge and in some cases is even better.

HP printers come with their own issues, such as the low on ink message, which will hassle you if you do not replace your ink cartridge with the correct type.
