A question that many of us will ask is just how can we make our printer perform to the highest of its ability? It is a question that for many of us will remain unanswered, due to the lack of information that is available to us. If we do not have any experience working with printers, then the chances are that we will just allow our printer to run with the factory settings it arrives to us with. These factory settings are not always the best option, and if you took the time to review the current settings of your printer, then you would realise this fact.

To ensure that you allow the printer to work to the best of its ability, then you have to ensure that you use the right types of paper and also the right type of ink. When printing images this is important, as although the PhotoSmart printer will produce an image onto normal printing paper the image may look grainy and may severely lack some of the detail in which you may expect. You can buy special photo paper or gloss paper in which to use with your PhotoSmart printer and print both perfect and clear images, each and every time.

Many people do not know this, but the bigger the image is that you print, the better the final quality of the image will be. We are aware that due to the cost of ink and ink cartridge in the market of today, it is not always going to be possible to print large images every time. We simply just want to point this fact out so that you are aware of it, for example if you happen to have an image that is close to your heart.

Another great way to ensure your printer is able to print the results you require, is to take a look at the image or document you wish to print. In the case of printing images, look closely at the image on your computer before you print, and see if there is any editing that you would like to carry out. This process will save you ink in the long term as you will only need to print the image once. Red eye removal is one cause of a bad picture; this can be edited before you print, and will therefore ensure the printer is able to print to and above your expectation.

Printers such as the HP PhotoSmart C6288 Printer, will be able to achieve the very highest standard in quality image printing, this is what they are designed to do. If you own this printer already and require [PhotoSmart C6288 Ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-photosmart-c6288-ink-cartridges) or any other types of HP compatible ink cartridge, then searching online are the easiest and the cheapest option.
