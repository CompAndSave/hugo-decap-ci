If you own a business that has any type of office department, then a printer will be used on a regular basis. It would not be unusual for some of the top businesses, to go through several ink cartridges per day, if your business is one that relies heavily on order processing and dispatches. The use of compatible ink cartridges could benefit you and your business and will help push your business to the next level. 

The reason we say this is because at the minute you are probably using what every other company uses, when the time comes to replace your ink supply.
