Ink Cartridges-What would we do without them? They certainly have made all our lives a lot easier. If your job involves printing, you understand that all too well. What once took days or even weeks to print now can be done in a few minutes-thanks to ink cartridges.

Ink cartridges, or more specifically, [inkjet cartridges](https://www.comboink.com/), is a small replaceable component that is used in a printer. Such ink cartridges can last for months before being replaced. In some places the ink can even be refilled so that it can be used over and over again. Ink cartridges can contain one or more partitioned reservoirs, or compartments, that can be connected with an electric contact and a chip that interacts with the printer that one is using.

But contrary to what some may think, not all ink cartridges are created equal, there are different brand name models and some contain more refined ink than others, which ones a consumer chooses to buy is left entirely up to them. But whatever ink cartridges they buy, they will still have to make sure that the flow of the ink runs smoothly, for the kind of printing one gets, will greatly depend on how smooth the inks flows within the printer.

It's always good to look at the ink indicator, which many modern-day printers have, to determine how much ink is left in the cartridge, many people have been frustrated or even embarrassed to discover they could not finish their project, because they did not have enough ink left in their printer cartridges. Sometimes the flow of dried ink can affect its performance, if this is the case, make sure that the ink head is wiped off with a small paper towel with a little isopropyl alcohol or on a Q-tip swab.

There are basically two different types of ink cartridges that are used in a printer, one that prints in all colours and one that prints the neutral colour black. Some ink cartridges even contain specially formatted inks, which are designed to print colour pictures.

Back to the various types of ink cartridges brands-which ones should you use? Again, you, the consumer, must decide. Many well-known ink cartridge companies often print their logo on their ink cartridges; they want others to know of their reputation. But whether you choose to use, brand name or [compatible cartridges](https://www.comboink.com/), make sure you use the ink cartridges that are right for your printer.
