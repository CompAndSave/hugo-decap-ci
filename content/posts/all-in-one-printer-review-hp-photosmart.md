HP has long been known to consistently produce only the very best printers and always use the latest in printing technology.

The one issue with this printer is that it does not seem to be as modern as the rest of the printer within the PhotoSmart series. Although the internal workings and components of the printer are more than capable of producing the same results as all other printers in the series, upon a first glance you can see that this is somewhat of a basic model. There is no LCD screen on the external case of the printer; this means that all selections of settings must be done using the external buttons on the printer. There is also no wireless printing option and the printer must be connected to a computer, unlike some other models of PhotoSmart printer which can use Bluetooth and wireless printing.

Despite these few minor downfalls, the printer is a dedicated image and photo printer. It is more than capable of producing fantastic results when you need those most. It is a printer that will continue to work for you, for several years, and also requires very little maintenance.
