As a new school year approaches, now is the time for some back to school shopping- buying things like stationery, books, electronics, new clothes, dorm room stuff and so on. All of this can tot up to quite a large outlay unless you know where to do your shopping. Luckily for all of us, many online stores are currently offering great deals to help you save on back to school shopping, either because of the tax holidays offered by the government or as a marketing strategy.
