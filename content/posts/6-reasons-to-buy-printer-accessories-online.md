Printer ink cartridges, toner cartridges, photo paper, cables and accessories – you can buy all these from your regular bricks and mortar retail outlet, or you can buy them online. So should you buy them online or should you purchase them elsewhere? We look at some of the top reasons to [**buy ink & toner cartridges**](https://www.comboink.com/), as well as other printer accessories online:

### The convenience

[![Buy Ink & Toner Online](/blog/images/online-shopping.jpg)](/blog/images/online-shopping.jpg)The convenience of online shopping is undeniable. You can go shopping any time you want; the store is open for you 24x7 regardless the time of day, holidays or weekends. You can be in your pajamas when you ‘go' shopping and never have to stir out of the comfort of your armchair! Also, there is no pressure of a salesperson breathing down your neck when you shop online!

### The price factor

The most important reason to [**buy printer cartridges and accessories online**](https://www.comboink.com/) is the price factor. An online store has fewer overheads and employee costs as compared to a bricks and mortar store. For this reason, an online store is able to pass on these lower costs to customers by way of discounts, freebies and other promotional offers. You will always find that the prices of cartridges and accessories are typically lower at online stores.

### Wider choice

You can visit a retail outlet and find that the cartridges or accessories of the particular brand or model you require are not available. However, this is far less likely to happen in the case of an online store, which stocks a much wider inventory, thus offering the customer a much wider choice.

### Home delivery

There is of course the convenience of having items delivered to your doorstep; you also save more in terms of the fuel and/or parking charges that you would have incurred from shopping a bricks and mortar store.

### You can compare prices

You have the benefit of being able to visit several different shops online to compare prices and then making the best and most informed decision, when you buy online.

### Reviews of online buyers

Another benefit for making your printer accessory purchases online is that you can read buyer reviews before making a purchase. You can read reviews of individual products, their quality and whether they deliver value for money. Also, you can read what people are saying about shopping with a particular online store – you can see what they are saying about the prices, speed of delivery, customer support and more.
