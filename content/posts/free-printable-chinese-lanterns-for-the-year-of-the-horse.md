As always, [ComboInk](https://www.comboink.com/) bring you good cheer and a simple fun way to enter into the festivities for the upcoming Chinese New Year. As with our free printables for [Christmas](https://www.comboink.com/blog/christmas-decoration-printables-from-comboink-com/) and [Halloween](https://www.comboink.com/blog/this-halloween-you-can-really-get-into/) , we've created some beautiful Chinese Lanterns, as part of the traditional décor for Chinese New Year celebrations.

As many of us may know, the Chinese calendar has a 12 year cycle, with each year being dedicated to a particular animal. The upcoming year will be the Year of the Horse and this year, the Chinese New Year will begin on the 31st of January.

Traditionally, these lanterns are hung out on doors and windows during the festive season to scare away the mythical beast called Nian. So put on your creative caps and take advantage of our free printable Chinese lanterns to celebrate this holiday:

**What You Will Need**

* Thick, slightly stiff printing paper or card stock
* A printer in good working order (ensure that the [ink cartridge](https://www.comboink.com/) is not exhausted)
* Scissors (safety scissors may be a good idea if children are making the lanterns)
* Light bulb candles (try not to use real candles within the lanterns to be safe)
* Glue, tape, gum or staplers
* Decoration items such as glitter, streamers, etc.
