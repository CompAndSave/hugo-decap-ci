Almost every household around the world will have acquired the services, of at least one computer. The modern day computer, is used for a wide variety of tasks, and die to the rapid decrease in price over the years, homes that would of never been able to purchase a desktop pc, are now able to fully understand and utilize their services.

We all use computers, for many different reasons, searching the internet, uploading our latest family pictures, social networking and even on occasions our overdue working assignments or children's homework. If you partake in any of these, the chances are that you will at some point, require the services of a printer.

Printers again over the years have dropped in price, this had made them more accessible to people, who own a computer. You can pick up a quality printer today, made from the most well-known of brands, for an easily affordable price.

You can print of your latest family pictures, your latest working assignments or even just print of a good recipe of the internet for tonight's romantic dinner. Whatever you use your printer for, there fall in price has dramatically contributed to the growth of the ink industry over the years.

In the early days of the market, all you would have seen would have been the genuine brands of printer, contributing to the market with their own inks. Although it is said that their own Ink cartridges are the best option, as they are specifically made for the printer, this is not always the case. In recent years we have seen compatible Ink cartridges and the offer of Cartridge refills creep onto the market, and gain a quality reputation.

The thing with compatible [ink cartridges](https://www.comboink.com/) is that they are designed to meet all of the printer manufacturer's stringent guidelines and specifications. They are offered at a much lower price, than the genuine types and they will offer you exactly the same service and top quality final prints.

This is the reason why, the ink industry has grown so wildly over the last few years. We have seen many more brands and manufacturers come out from hiding, and start making a contribution to the world of printing. I think it is safe to say, that as the technology improves and the range of printers available becomes bigger, then so will the range of Ink cartridges and printing inks that are available on the market.
