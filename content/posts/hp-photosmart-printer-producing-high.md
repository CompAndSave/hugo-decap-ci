I have always admired the way in which HP are able to release new state of the art products. It is clear that they input much time and effort into their research and also the design of their products. One of the latest printers to appear in the PhotoSmart range from HP, is the PhotoSmart C6185 printer. If you are a keen photographer or are simple just looking to print of images to a high standard then this may just be the printer, you have been waiting for. I have used this printer on numerous occasions, and I must admit that it does live up to the expectations I held, in regards to this printer.

The Printer is an all in one printer, which enables it to assist you in not only printing tasks, but also Copying and faxing tasks. It can use wireless technology, which means that you can send images to your printer without the use of horrible looking cables. You can now print images from your computer or laptop, even if you are currently in a different location to the printer. If you do not own a computer at all, then you can still use the PhotoSmart C6185 printer, to print your images.

The Printer requires little expertise in computers, as it is easy to set up and also to use. This is a printer that really sets the standard for other brands to follow, I have experienced problems with other brands of printer, as they seem to have a few buttons which are designed to carry out many different processes, all this does is make the printer hard to use.

Most Smartphones or digital camera will come with a memory card. This memory card can then be inserted into your printer and the images or documents which are on the device can then be selected, then printed. The built in LCD, which comes as a part of the printer enable you, to quickly search through the many printing options on offer and also allow you to look through the content on the memory card, you have inserted into the printer.

The HP PhotoSmart C6185 printer is an ink jet printer, which means that it used the traditional ink cartridge. These ink cartridges could quickly see their levels drop, if the printer is used on a daily basis, or is used in an office type environment. To buy replacement [PhotoSmart C6185 ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-photosmart-c6185-ink-cartridges) take a look at all options available to you. I recommend taking a look at the compatible ink cartridges, as the genuine types of cartridges could become expensive, if you need to replace your ink cartridges on a monthly or even weekly basis.
