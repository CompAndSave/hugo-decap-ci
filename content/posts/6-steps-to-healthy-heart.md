[![](/blog/images/7K0A0259.JPG)](/blog/images/7K0A0259.JPG)Every February, we observe American Heart Month to raise awareness of heart disease in men and women across the United States. Statistically, [1 in 4 deaths are caused by heart disease.](http://healthfinder.gov/nho/februarytoolkit.aspx) However, there are some pretty simple changes you can make in your everyday life to significantly reduce your risk of becoming a victim! Leading a heart healthy life is important for not only you, but for those dear to you as well. Here are 6 easy ways to increase your heart health through everyday activities.

#### Know The Signs

First off, it's important that you recognize the signs of a heart attack. Sometimes, those suffering from mild heart attacks don't even know it! The faster you act once you notice symptoms, the better off you will be. In general, fatigue, tightness in your jaw and neck (for women, men watch out for numbness in chest and shoulder areas), shortness of breath, nausea and sudden sweats may all be symptoms of heart disease.

#### Stress Less

High levels of stress are not healthy for your heart. In fact, those that are happier and focus on good things in their life have less of a chance of getting heart disease. To [decrease stress levels](https://www.comboink.com/blog/easy-ways-to-prevent-stress-at-work-lower-stroke-risk/), make sure to check your blood pressure regularly, prioritize your most important tasks daily, don't sweat the small stuff and schedule time on a weekly basis to do things YOU enjoy.

#### Sleep Better

A good night's sleep can make a world of difference. The amount of sleep you need may vary from person to person, but in general, 7-8 hours a night is ideal. Not getting the proper amount of sleep can increase stress levels, lead to an unhealthy diet and decrease energy levels. All of which are not good for preventing heart disease.

#### Take Supplements

Even with a healthy diet, you may not be getting the supplements you need daily. Taking Vitamin D, fish oil and probiotic supplements will help maintain normal calcium levels, fight high blood pressure, increase energy levels and balance your digestive system.

#### Start a Healthier Diet

Portion control is an easy, effective way to lower your risk of heart disease. Reduce your sodium and cholesterol intake and increase your daily dose of fresh fruits and veggies. Apples, tomatoes, pomegranate and garlic are just some examples of food that have crazy good heart benefits.

#### Exercise Regularly

Exercise is key to a healthy lifestyle. And it doesn't have to be exhaustive! Doing at least 2.5 hours a week will significantly improve your overall well-being and reduce your risk of heart diseaseâ€¦that's only 30 minutes each weekday, you have time for that!
