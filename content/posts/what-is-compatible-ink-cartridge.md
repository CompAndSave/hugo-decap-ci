When printers had started to fall in price and become a little more affordable to the general public, People started to buy printers to use as part of their home computing system. This had never been possible in the past years due to the amount of money the manufacturer would charge for the initial purchase of a printer. However despite the cost of the printer starting to fall, it was a clever tactic to use from the original manufacturers of the printer we see on the market today.

One item that did not fall in price, and actually has been seen to rise in price over the last few years, is the genuine ink cartridge. This is how the brands who make these printers gain their profits, and if you think carefully about it, then you can see that by lowering the cost of the printer, more people will buy them. As a result of more people buying and using their printers, then there will be more money spent on replacement ink cartridges; as a result the profits start to see a huge increase.

It wasn't long before people started to become wise to this money making scheme, and started to look elsewhere to gain there replacement ink cartridges. At the start there was the method of taking an empty ink cartridge and using a refill kit to replenish the supplies of ink. This is a lengthy process and after all has been completed you are still not guaranteed the results. There are other problems with this method, as you cannot guarantee the quality of the ink, and it was also very difficult to actually complete without making a mess. Printers had also started to reject the replenished ink cartridge, as once the cartridge had been inserted back into the system; many printers still recognised the cartridge as being empty.

In the market of today we now have the compatible ink cartridge, and to date it seems that it is the answer to all of our prayers. They only cost a low amount of money and it is not uncommon for you to be able to buy three compatible ink cartridges for the price of one genuine type. The quality of the ink included within is of an equal or better grade, and you will actually see that there is more ink within the cartridge; therefore it will last longer than the more expensive genuine types.

Printer like the HP PhotoSmart D7255 have the potential to use a large amount of ink, this is because they are an all in one printer. They also use six ink cartridges instead of the more common four ink system, and so to save money on [PhotoSmart D7255 ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-photosmart-d7255-ink-cartridges) and all other models of printer, you should seek to use the compatible ink cartridge.
