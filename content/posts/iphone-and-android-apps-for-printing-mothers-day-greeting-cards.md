There are smartphone apps that will convert normal faces into terrifying zombies that growl and snap, there is a bowel movement tracking app, there is the annoy-a-teen app, there is a game for cats, a fake-an-excuse-hang-up-now app and there is even a pimple popping app! So there is a plethora of seemingly useless mobile apps out there. Fortunately though, there are some very useful and practical apps out there as well, such as the apps that help you create greeting cards for Mother's Day which falls on the second Sunday of every May (on May 10th this year). Send physical cards, animated messages, musical ecards and more:
