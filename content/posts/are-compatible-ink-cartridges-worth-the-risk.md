The aim of this article is to answer the question that many of us are faced with when we are selecting the replacement ink cartridges for our printer. The compatible ink cartridge is not very well advertised to be honest with you; however this is in part down to the original manufacturer of the printer constantly playing them down. I believe that this is because they feel that they finally have some really good competition to contend with, and if it was not for the huge advertising campaigns of the OEM ink cartridge, then the compatible variations would have already been placed at the top of the market.

The problem that many people encounter is the huge price of the OEM cartridge, and because of this price, we just cannot afford to use these types of products. We live in a world where there is not much spare cash floating around, and we as the customer do our best to hold onto what little cash we actually have to ourselves. Buying a replacement ink cartridge for our printer is the least of our worries in this current financial climate.

The compatible ink cartridge will eventually take the lead sales position in the next few years, and once people begin to realize just how good they are, when compared to the OEM types, then the sales will dramatically increase. So the question is them, is the compatible ink cartridge worth the risk?

## Does it Worth the Risk?

The correct answer to this question is yes, and they are not only worth the risk, they are also worth the time you spend reading this article to gain more knowledge about them.
