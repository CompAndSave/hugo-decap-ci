In this article we are going to take a look at one of the latest printers to have been released from Hewlett Packard, the PhotoSmart D7155 printer. As the name of the printer suggests it is a dedicated image printer, which means that it has been specifically designed and built to produce only the finest images, when it is used to print in such tasks. However this does not mean that it is not capable of completing any other type of printing task. It is actually just the opposite, as it can easily achieve results that many other brands and style of printer, will find difficult to match.

If we take a quick look at the design of the printer, we find that it comes in a modern outer casing to protect the internal components. The design even looks a little futuristic in some areas, and once again this is an area in which many other printers appear to fall behind the mark. It was not too long ago that the printer you will have owned was just a dull old piece of equipment sat next to your computer or laptop, today with printers such as the PhotoSmart D7155 printer; you can actually make the printer feel a part of your home.

The next part of the printer that we stumbled upon was the ideal spaces or slots which had been left on the external case, which would enable us to insert a memory card or other formats of compatible memory. This on its own is a great reason in why you should use this printer, as it makes the printing process so much easier. All you have to do is insert the memory card and then select which documents are images you wish to print using the both smart and conveniently placed LCD screen, which the printer has integrated into the system.

If you have never used a printer before then the PhotoSmart D7155 printer, would be an ideal first printer for you to use. We also tested the printer, to see just how good the final results were, and the results as expected where of a great quality. It did not matter whether you print images or documents; the printer was able to print at a fantastic speed, without the loss of any detail. In our professional opinion this printer is one of the best printers on the market today, and you will also find that you can now find them for a good price, if you look in the right places.

We also recommend that you look to buy compatible ink cartridges, when the time comes for you to replace you [PhotoSmart D7155 ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-photosmart-d7155-ink-cartridges) supplies. They offer the exact same quality as the genuine types, and will also save you even more money in the long term.
