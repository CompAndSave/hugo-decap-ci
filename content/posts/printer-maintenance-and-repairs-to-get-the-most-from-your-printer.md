In the current financial market of today, the last thing that we need is to be spending money on a new printer. Why should we have to pay extra money on buying a new printer, if we have already spent money on what once was a perfectly good printer, not too long ago? The answer to this question is that we don't, and if you ever do encounter any problems with your printer, you will find that it is normally a simple fix. Too many of us are quick to assume that once we encounter a problem with our printer that it is broken, I have personally seen someone throw out a printer, just because of a paper jam.

Maintenance of your printer is a vital part of your printer health. If you keep on top of the maintenance of your printer, then you will find that you very rarely encounter a problem. It is an overlooked area by many people who own a printer, and your printer is just the same as your car. If you don't service your car on a regular basis, then you can expect it to break down, this is the same with your printer. Printers come in various shapes and sizes, which model or type of printer you own, will allow for the amount or type of maintenance that you have to carry out. 

In the case of an ink jet printer the maintenance is actually quite simple. The most important component of an ink jet printer is the print head, and it is this component that you should look after to ensure that you do not encounter problems with the quality of your final print. If the ink in your ink cartridges becomes dry, then this is the time you will begin to experience problems.

To ensure that this does not happen to you, all you have to do is make sure that your printer is used on a regular basis. If you do not have a reason to use your printer, then most printers will have an option to print a test page. In using this option you will make sure that the ink in the ink cartridges your printer uses will not dry up.
