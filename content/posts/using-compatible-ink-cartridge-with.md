If you are one of the millions of households which own a printer worldwide, then you should be using a compatible ink cartridge. There are many reasons for this, and if you have never heard of them, then you will not be alone. There are thousands of people who are still paying over the top prices for genuine or OEM ink cartridges; it must be made known that you do not have to pay this kind of money, just so that you can use your printer.

Compatible ink cartridges hold several benefits; these are benefits that you may not know about. The main advantage of using a compatible ink cartridge is the fact that they are much cheaper to purchase. Every person who already uses the compatible cartridge will tell you that this is the main reason that they actually decided to start using the compatible cartridge, rather than the much more highly priced OEM type. There are other benefits though, and one which makes the compatible ink cartridge significantly better that the genuine types is the fact that they actually have a larger ink content.

If the ink cartridge has an larger ink content then this means that the cartridge will be able to last longer and it also means that the ink cartridge will serve you well. Why would you wish to pay more money for a product that will not be able to live up to a product that is much cheaper? We believe the answer is that we are all tricked into thinking the genuine ink cartridge will be the best option for our printer. We are all told by the manufacturer of the printer, that their own genuine replacement cartridges are the only cartridges which will make the printer perform; this is simply not the case.

The ink that these compatible ink cartridges come supplied with is also of an excellent quality. Many people are quick to think that you get what you pay for, however this is not the case with the compatible cartridge, as they are produced through a very effective third agent. The result of using a third agent means lower overall costs, better ink quality and also a longer lasting cartridge. If you currently use a printer such as the HP PhotoSmart C7280, then you will more than likely use it on a daily basis. If you do then you will probably need to purchase replacement ink supplies on a regular basis, save yourself money on [PhotoSmart C7280 ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-photosmart-c7280-ink-cartridges) by using compatible ink cartridges.
