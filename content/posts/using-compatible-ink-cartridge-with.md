## Cost Savings and Performance Explained

If you are one of the millions of households which own a printer worldwide, then you should be using a compatible ink cartridge. There are many reasons for this, and if you have never heard of them, then you will not be alone. There are thousands of people who are still paying over the top prices for genuine or OEM ink cartridges; it must be made known that you do not have to pay this kind of money, just so that you can use your printer.

If the ink cartridge has an larger ink content then this means that the cartridge will be able to last longer and it also means that the ink cartridge will serve you well. Why would you wish to pay more money for a product that will not be able to live up to a product that is much cheaper? We believe the answer is that we are all tricked into thinking the genuine ink cartridge will be the best option for our printer. We are all told by the manufacturer of the printer, that their own genuine replacement cartridges are the only cartridges which will make the printer perform; this is simply not the case.

The result of using a third agent means lower overall costs, better ink quality and also a longer lasting cartridge.
