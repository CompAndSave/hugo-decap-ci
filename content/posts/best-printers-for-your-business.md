Time for a new printer at work? There are so many [printer options](http://blog.comboink.local/how-to-choose-best-printer/) that choosing which one is right for your business can be daunting.

First, you need to determine how much printing you do. If your business does quite a bit of printing, you'll want to check out [laser printers](http://blog.comboink.local/advantages-of-laser-printer/). These kinds of printers can handle a large volume of printing and produce high-quality results. However, a laser printer sometimes requires some warm-up time before you can use it.  
  
Inkjet printers are more common in home offices as they tend to be less expensive. An inkjet printer, though, can still generate smooth, photographic-quality results and doesn't have the warm-up time of a laser printer.

Keep reading below to see the best laser and inkjet printer choices for your business. Which one will you choose?

## Laser Printers

Brother is a well-recommended brand for laser printers. The Brother HL-L6200DW mono laser printer has wireless networking, duplex printing, and large paper capacity capabilities as well as a low cost per page. Brother's HL-L2360DW is an affordable black and white laser printer for light- to medium-duty output.

If you need to tackle very large print jobs, HP's LaserJet Enterprise M604n and M605n mono laser printers are fast and easy to manage.

As long as you don't need to print photos, the Dell B3460dn mono laser printer has great print speed, cost per page, and paper capacity for heavy-printing offices.

A much better choice for printing photos is the Canon Color ImageClass MF820Cdn. This all-in-one (AIO) color laser printer delivers excellent print and scan quality, large paper capacity, and reasonably quick speed.

## Inkjet Printers

Epson's WorkForce Pro series has several printers ideal for both small offices and larger businesses. Due to its speed and low running costs, the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-6590 gets high marks as a small-office, color inkjet multifunction printer (MFP). Epson WorkForce Pro WF-8590 is also an MFP with top speed that can print at tabloid size and larger. A fast and ink-efficient AIO printer, the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-5690 is great for high-volume printing and color output.

HP's Officejet Pro AIO printers are also highly rated for printing, scanning, copying, and faxing. You'll want to take a look at the HP Officejet Pro 8000 or HP Officejet Pro 6000 if your team shares a printer.

Another HP option is the HP PageWide Pro 552dw, which delivers excellent speed, ample paper capacity, and laser-quality text.

Don't be fooled by its compact sizeâ€”the Canon Maxify iB4020 wireless small office inkjet printer provides generous paper capacity, low running costs, and good output quality.
