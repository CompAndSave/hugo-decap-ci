[![Ink and Toner Cartridges](/blog/images/archive/2016/06/ti-product-shot-1-300x150.jpg)](/blog/images/archive/2016/06/ti-product-shot-1.jpg)How often do you print? Once a week? Multiple times a day? Hardly ever? If you print often, you
know how frustrating it can be to run out of ink in the middle of a job. But, what's even more frustrating is going to buy a replacement cartridge and finding out they cost almost as much as the printer did in the first place. But never fear, cheap replacement cartridges are here!

### Compatible vs Remanufactured?

The first step in evaluating [remanufactured cartridges](https://www.comboink.com/) is understanding the difference between compatible and remanufactured. Compatible means that the ink cartridge was not made by your printer manufacturer, but they are made to work with your specific model and series by a third-party company. On the other hand, remanufactured cartridges use the same empty [OEM](https://www.comboink.com/) (original equipment manufacturer) cartridges. These cartridges are then sent to a third-party manufacturer who will recycle these cartridges into another usable product. This process includes cleaning and testing the old cartridges, replacing any defective parts, and refilling them with ink.

### How They Work

It is commonly believed that remanufactured inks do not produce the same high quality as their generic counterparts, but that is far from true. Sure, not all companies will produce the same high-quality results as the generic brands, but if you do your research online before buying and check out their online reputation, you can learn a lot about the quality. Buying from a reputable company will help you rest easy knowing you made a smart purchase.

### What They Can Do

Each years, thousands of ink and toner cartridges are thrown away and tossed into landfills, almost 400,000 tons worth! What's more, it can take up to 1,000 years for these cartridges to decompose!
Most people think of ink and toner cartridges as a one-time-use item, but the fact is, they can be refilled up to 15 times. Think of how much waste that would keep out of our landfills each year and how that could affect our environment for years to come.

When thinking about your next ink or toner purchase, keep in mind the significant cost of OEM cartridges to both your wallet and the Earth. Buying remanufactured not only [saves you money](https://www.comboink.com/about), but it helps to save the environment too!
