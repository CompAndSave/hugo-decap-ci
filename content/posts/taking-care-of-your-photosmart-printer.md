If you have recently purchased a PhotoSmart printer, then you will probably wish to look after your investment. Printers in the market of today can be found at a relatively low price, however a printer which offers as much as the PhotoSmart series will offer you, will be a little more expensive. Money is just not something that we have much of these days, and in the current financial climate, if our printer was to break down on us, then it would not be replaced quickly. 

To keep our printer working, and also able to produce the same results it will have given you from the first day of purchase, general maintenance is a must. Many people will just leave their printer alone and eventually the printer will stop working. General maintenance is very easy to carry out, and should be done on a regular basis; the problem is that many people do not know how to complete this general maintenance. The PhotoSmart C6270 is a very up to date and modernized printer, however this does not mean that you will never come across any problems throughout your use. 

One if the easiest and quickest maintenance tasks that you can complete on your own. Is to format and clean the print head. Many printers including the printers which are a part of the PhotoSmart printer will have a button that is on the printer for this specific purpose. If your printer is connected to your computer, then you will also have installed the software that the printer uses. This software may also have an option that will allow you to begin the very same process. 

As mentioned printers in the PhotoSmart series are very up to date and modern, and with this if the printer has any problems it will be able to inform you of them through either your computer or the built in LCD screen. Other maintenance should be done also on the actual ink cartridges, you should keep in mind that if they are left for a significant amount of time, then they may dry up. To counter this, your PhotoSmart printer will have the option to print a test page, use this to your advantage as it will stop the ink cartridges from this problem.

If you have had problems with your ink cartridges, or your ink has run out and you need to replenish your supply of [PhotoSmart C6270 ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-photosmart-c6270-ink-cartridges), make sure you are aware of the right ink cartridges you need for that printer. Printer ink cartridges all look very similar, however many are very different.
