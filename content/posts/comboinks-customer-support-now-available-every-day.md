Sometimes the weekend can't come fast enough, and sometimes you need help finding out how to pass the time - and we have a solution. Call us.

The ComboInk Team is happy to announce customer service hours are extended to the weekends. We realize it might sound uncommon to call a printer cartridge company on a Saturday morning, but that's okay.

Our customer support team is ready to help you with questions about your compatible ink or toner, order tracking, and any other comments or concerns. Now, as for being chased by a bear, we don't think we can be of much help there…but we'll try our best with your ink & toner inquiries.
