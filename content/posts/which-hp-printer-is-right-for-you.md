Are you looking to buy a new inkjet or laser printer? Hewlett Packard (HP) offers a wide selection of printers that are some of the most popular on the market for your home or office. But because of all the options available, it can be difficult choosing which HP printer is right for your printing needs.

If you're considering purchasing a new printer for your personal use, check out HP DeskJet, HP Envy, and HP Photosmart printers. HP OfficeJet and HP LaserJet printers are ideal for your home office or business.

## HP Printers for Home

### DeskJet 

Let's start with HP's current DeskJet series. The HP DeskJet 1112 printer is a very affordable, basic option, but it only prints. If you need to copy and scan in addition to printing, then choose the HP DeskJet 2130 or DeskJet 3755 all-in-one (AIO) printers. The DeskJet 2130 is about $20 more than the 1112 model. The 3755 is more than double the 1112.

Even though the HP website has discontinued selling many other DeskJet printers, they are still available at Amazon and Walmart. One of those is the HP DeskJet 2542\. This AIO printer averages four out of five stars on Walmart and Amazon. [HP DeskJet 2542 ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-deskjet-2542-ink-cartridges) is offered as both standard yield and high yield. The high-yield [61XL ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-61xl-ink-cartridges-ch563wn-ch564wn-2-pk) cartridges often save you between 20-30% per page.

### Envy

HP presently has four Envy printers available on its website. All of the HP Envy printers are multifunction printers (MFPs). 

The HP Envy 5540 and HP Envy 4520 copy and scan as well as offer borderless printing and auto duplex printing. Want a speedier printer? Go for the premium, more expensive HP Envy 7640 and HP Envy 5660 e-AIO printers. These HP printers have the same features as the models mentioned above but achieve faster pages per minute (ppm). The 4520 version takes high-yield [63XL ink](https://www.comboink.com/nsearch/?q=hp%20envy%204520) while the 5540, 5660, and 7640 models can take high-yield [62XL ink](https://www.comboink.com/Hewlett-Packard-HP-62XL-HY-Black-Ink-Cartridge-p/ink-hp-c2p05an.htm) and lower-yield [62 ink](https://www.comboink.com/Hewlett-Packard-HP-62-Black-Ink-Cartridge-p/ink-hp-c2p04an.htm).

Available at Amazon and Walmart, the HP Envy 4502 and HP Envy 5535 are color photo printers, scanners, and copiers. Like the 5660 and 7640, these two well-reviewed printers are e-AIO. They have wireless direct and local Wi-Fi connectivity for mobile printing. You can use standard [HP 61 ink](https://www.comboink.com/Hewlett-Packard-HP-61-Black-Ink-Cartridge-p/ink-hp-ch561wn.htm) or high-yield [HP 61XL ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-61xl-ink-cartridges-ch563wn-ch564wn-2-pk) in both printer models. 

### Photosmart

The HP Photosmart printers' capabilities range from printing only to photo printing, scanning, copying, and faxing. Although HP has discontinued this series, you can find new and refurbished models on Amazon and other retailers. Plus, ComboInk.com supplies numerous discount ink cartridges for older or discontinued printers. For example, if you need [HP Photosmart 7525 ink](https://www.comboink.com/nsearch/?q=hp%20photosmart%207525) for your printer, save money and buy a bulk set of four [HP 564XL ink cartridges](https://www.comboink.com/hp-564xl-bulk-set-of-4-high-yield-ink-cartridges-p/zink-hp-hp564xl-combo4.htm).

## HP Printers for Business

### OfficeJet

The OfficeJet Pro series is perfect for small workgroups and businesses. Your team will appreciate the ease of use, professional-quality color documents, and mobile connectivity. Like the Envy printers, all the OfficeJet Pro printers are MFPs.

The HP OfficeJet Pro 6000 prints up to 17 ppm while the HP OfficeJet Pro 8000 prints up to 20 ppm. You can still find [HP 950XL ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-950xl-high-yield-black-ink-cartridge-p/ink-hp-cn045an.htm) and [HP 951XL ink](https://www.comboink.com/hp-950xl-951xl-combo-4-high-yield-ink-cartridge-p/zink-hp-950xl-951xl-combo4.htm) for some of the older models, such as the HP OfficeJet Pro 8620.

Do you print a lot of borderless flyers and other marketing materials? If so, you should think about a wide-format printer. HP currently has two wide-format AIO printers: HP OfficeJet Pro 7740 and HP OfficeJet Pro 7510\. HP OfficeJet 7612 is a slightly older wide-format model that uses the high-yield [HP 932](https://www.comboink.com/hp-932xl-high-yield-black-ink-cartridge-p/ink-hp-cn053an.htm) ink cartridge.

### LaserJet

For larger work teams, consider the HP LaserJet Enterprise series. The LaserJets are designed to handle heavy print jobs for your business. The cheaper options are print only whereas the pricier ones are MFP. Stick with the lower models if your business doesn't do much copying or scanning. And don't forget to stock up on [laser toner cartridges](https://www.comboink.com/nsearch/?q=laserjet%20enterprise).
