[![Father's Day Card](/blog/images/Snap54.jpg)](/blog/images/Snap54.jpg)Why go out and get a commercially made card that is just like a thousand others when you can create a unique and personalized card by yourself? It's really simple too – here's how to go about creating these special Father's Day printables. We have two options for you: [**The Shirt Card**](https://www.comboink.com/download/printables/shirt-card.pdf) and [**The Tie Card**](https://www.comboink.com/download/printables/tie-card.pdf) – clicking on either of these two will take you to the PDF page where you'll find the card designs we've created.

### The Shirt Card for Father's Day

[**The Shirt Card**](https://www.comboink.com/download/printables/shirt-card.pdf) consists of a shirt like design with the words _My Dad, My Hero_ and followed by lines that you can fill in with your own special message for your father. Just give the print command, and then cut along the dashed lines; then write your own message, you're done!

[![Father's Day Card](/blog/images/Snap53.jpg)](/blog/images/Snap53.jpg)[**The Tie Card**](https://www.comboink.com/download/printables/tie-card.pdf) is shaped like a necktie and we've offered you three color and wording options: the green one just says _Happy Father's Day_, the plum color scheme says _For the World's Best Dad_ and a blue card has the simple but heartfelt message _Love You Daddy._ Just print out the PDF file and cut along the dashed lines.
