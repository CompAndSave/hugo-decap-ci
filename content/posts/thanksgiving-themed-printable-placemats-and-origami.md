**Here's what you need to get started:**

* Glue (kid friendly)
* Scissors (kid friendly)
* Coloring materials (crayons, markers, colored pencils, paint, etc.)
* A family ready to have some fun
* Someone willing to print out the placemats, as well as the origami designs and receive a whole lot of smiles and hugs in return

**To download the placemats and origami turkey images:**

* Click on the link below to "DOWNLOAD" the placemats and origami designs with the instructions (this will open a PDF file version)
